## Current work: Rodent Lesion Segmentation with Deep Learning
Rodents are widely used as models in research to study diseases and to develop drugs, and medical imaging is a non-invasive way to examine them. Scientists studying lesion development typically have to delineate the lesion in order to study its characteristics, and this is a time-consuming subjective task. Previous methods rely on registration, pre-processing steps or they are not fully automatic, and this can produce non-consistent results. Currently I am researching and developing a rodent lesion segmentation tool with deep learning.
